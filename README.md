# WordGuess-CLI

This is my CIL "Hangman" or Word Guess Game. It uses constructor functions to output data from a constructor to play a Hangman game from a list of words related to the National Parks of America. 

Type in node index.js to start the game.

You will be asked to guess a letter A-Z and when you press enter it will return a response of 'Correct' and replace the corresponding underscore with the letter if the letter is in the word, or 'Incorrect' if the letter is not in the word and remove one of your guesses remaining. 
If you guess a letter you have already guessed, the program will ask for a new letter. 
When you either guess all the letters or run out of remaining guesses, it ends the game in either win or loss and asks if you would like to play again. If you would like to play again, it will restart the game with a new word, if you select no, it ends the game.

Enjoy!
